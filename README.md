# ðŸš€ AI-Powered Study Support System using RAG with FAISS & Google Gemini ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š

## ðŸ“¢ Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered study support system** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to allow users to upload multiple PDF files and retrieve **accurate, context-aware answers** based on their content. The system combines **FAISS** for efficient document retrieval and **Google Gemini LLM** for intelligent response generation.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- âœ… **Multi-PDF Upload** â€“ Users can upload multiple PDFs and process them dynamically.
- âœ… **AI-Powered Q&A** â€“ Ask questions, and the system retrieves relevant answers based on the uploaded documents.
- âœ… **FAISS Vector Search** â€“ Efficient document retrieval using **FAISS** as the vector database.
- âœ… **Google Gemini LLM** â€“ Generates **contextual and intelligent responses**.
- âœ… **Real-time Processing** â€“ Chunking, embedding, and storing documents for seamless interaction.
- âœ… **Streamlit UI** â€“ Simple and interactive user interface for smooth user experience.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- ðŸ”¹ **Python** | **LangChain** | **FAISS** | **Google Gemini** | **Streamlit**
- ðŸ”¹ **Document Processing:** PyPDFLoader, Recursive Text Splitting
- ðŸ”¹ **Embeddings:** Google Gemini (`models/embedding-001`)
- ðŸ”¹ **LLM Model:** Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`)

## ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters?

This project is designed to support **academic** by helping students, researchers, and professionals **extract insights** from large PDF documents efficiently. However, you can use it for any kind of pdf files.
